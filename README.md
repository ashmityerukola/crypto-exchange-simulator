# Crypto Exchange Simulator (C++)

This is a course project for a computer science class focused on practicing
C++ object-oriented programming and data structures.

## Overview
The project simulates a basic crypto exchange where users can:
- Deposit and withdraw assets
- Place buy and sell orders
- Match orders and execute trades
- Track portfolios and trade history

The project framework was provided by the instructor, and I implemented
the core exchange logic and user account functionality.

## Concepts Used
- C++ classes and object-oriented design
- STL containers (map, vector)
- Order matching and partial fills
- Operator overloading
- Header/source file separation

## Running the Project
Compile all source files and run `main.cpp`.
